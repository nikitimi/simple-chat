# Changelogs [SOLVED]:
### 2023-04-18 [reference](./README.md#2023-04-16)
- Chats renders previous data before rendering new array.
- Chat heads doesn't update correctly unlike `preview` branch.

# Known Issues:

### 2023-04-18
- UI Design needs a structure so the interactions between components would result the expected outcome.
- After deleting a conversation, a null `Chat Modal` persists, and sometimes the remaining user is referenced in the deleted `Chat Modal`

### 2023-04-16
- Chats renders previous data before rendering new array.
- Chat heads doesn't update correctly unlike `preview` branch.
- Context providers isn't efficient enough, needs logic reconsideration as some functionality is not working as expected.
- UI Design, Chat heads tends to overlap the Chat modal in smaller screen.
- Need to remove Redux as It doesn't support non-serializable data, moving to useContext instead.
